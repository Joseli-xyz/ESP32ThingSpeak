# Description 

-This is a completed and finished version of the code, it allows the use of one DHT sensor only, and itÂ´s temperature and humidity modules as well. 
You will need to use your local WiFi, with your password to make it work.
It also comes with codes for a secondary DHT sensor, and for a BMP module. 
You will need the ESP32, DHT, Adafruit and ThingSpeak libraries to be installed to work, included with a ThingSpeak account.

To make it run, just simply open your Arduino IDE, verify the code and upload it, make sure you press the BOOT button on the right second.
